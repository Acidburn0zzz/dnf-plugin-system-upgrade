.SH NAME
.PP
dnf system\-upgrade \- upgrade a system to a new major release

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dnf system\-upgrade download \-\-releasever
.I VERSION
.RI [ OPTIONS ]
.br
.B dnf system\-upgrade reboot

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]dnf system\-upgrade\f[] is used to upgrade a system to a new major
release.
.PP
The \f[B]download\f[] command downloads all the packages needed to
upgrade to the given \f[I]VERSION\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]reboot\f[] command prepares the system to perform the upgrade
and reboots. This can only be used after the \f[B]download\f[] command
completes successfully.
.PP
The \f[B]clean\f[] command can be used to remove previously\-downloaded
data. This happens automatically at the end of a successful upgrade.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-\-releasever= VERSION
REQUIRED. The version to upgrade to.
Sets \f[I]$releasever\f[] in all enabled repos.
Usually a number, or \f[B]rawhide\f[].
.TP
.B \-\-distro\-sync
Behave like \f[B]dnf distro\-sync\f[]: always install packages from the
new release, even if they are older than the currently\-installed
version.
.TP
.BI \-\-datadir= DIRECTORY
Save downloaded packages to \f[I]DIRECTORY\f[].
\f[I]DIRECTORY\f[] must already exist.
This directory \f[I]must\f[] be mounted automatically by the system or
the upgrade will not work.
The default is \f[C]/var/lib/dnf/system\-update\f[].

.SH NOTES
.PP
This command replaces \f[B]fedup\f[].
The backward\-compatibility wrapper program /usr/bin/fedup is provided
only as a convenience, and may be removed in a future release.
.PP
Any problems encountered on your system after the upgrade completes
should be reported to the maintainers of the affected components.
In other words: if (for example) KDE stops working, report that to the KDE
maintainers.

.SH BUGS
.PP
DNF versions older than 1.0.0 cannot show upgrade progress on the graphical
boot splash screen.
.PP
Upgrading from install media (e.g. a DVD or .iso file) currently requires the
user to manually set up a DNF repo and fstab entry for the media.
